            <li> A challenge I had was figuring out what image to choose of myself as I don't have much
                 that show me clearly. I worked through this by going through my photos and ultimately settling
                 on an image that seemed the most clear. Another challenge I had was figuring out how I wanted to 
                 publish these pages to the web. I worked through them through a lot of referencing of the assignment
                 prompt, and google searches. A third challenge was understanding the unix commands when publishing the 
                 pages on the ENGR web space. I worked through this through a mix of the links provided in the prompt
                 as well as some google searching as well. A fourth thing I encountered was figuring out how to change the 
                 background color, the text, and how to space things out between the text. I worked through this by doing 
                 some google searches, which have been very helpful. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Something I learned from this assignment was how to publish pages to the web, so that it's not only 
                viewable locally, but also live on the web. Another thing I learned was Unix permissions. I don't 
                entirely understand it all but I think I at least somewhat do and at least understand enough to 
                accomplish the needed permissions as specified. 

            </li>

            <li> 
                The resources that were most helpful were the links within the assignment #1 prompt, the campuswire forum, 
                and the notes I had from lectures. I used the campuswire forum by referring to it when I realized I had 
                similar if not the same questions that others had previously asked. I used the links and the notes I had
                from lectures whenever there was something I came across while doing the assignment that made me think of 
                something I saw earlier that could possibly help in solving it.
